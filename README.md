# High-Order-Functions
<p align="justify"><b>A high-order function</b> is a function that receives another function as a parameter or returns a function as a return value. 
In other words, thanks to high-order-functions, we can work on callback functions and functional programming. There are 4 
important high order functions that are frequently used in daily life in Javascript. These are foreach(), map(), find() 
and filter(). My goal is to write these functions manually to internalize the concepts better.</p>
